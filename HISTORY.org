- Breaking change

  - User Interface: Exposes multitude of Org2Blog features for easy use.
  - Documentation: Added for all features.
  - Status information explaining what is happening and what you can do next.
  - Combination of user interface and additional documentation make for easier
    use.
- Refinement
  - Added dependency on Emacs 26.2 and Org mode 9.2.2 included with it
  - When you make xml-rpc calls, you can specify the blod id. However, org2blog
    always uses blog id '1'. There is no other way to do it. That value
    'org2blog/wp-server-blogid' is a defvar, but it isn't set anywhere. In one
    place, it is checked for in `o2b-user-login`, and if it can't find it, then
    it defaults to 1. This is now a constant.

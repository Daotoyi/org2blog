* Overview

- org2blog/wp
  - Keeps everything else but the code in it's [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/wiki][Wiki]].
  - Is one of the two packages named org2blog. The other is org2blog/atom by
    [[http://tehom-blog.blogspot.com/][Tom Breton]].
  - Should, /ideally/, work with any platform that supports ~xml-rpc~ but some of
    WordPress specific features may not work.
  - Was inspired by and based on a [[http://paste.lisp.org/display/69993][WordPress posting client for muse-mode]]
    written by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AshishShukla][Ashish Shukla]].

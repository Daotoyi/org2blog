* Overview
  org2blog provides a simple way of publishing from org-mode to
  (wordpress) blogs.  Presently supports posting with categories, tags
  and images.  It uploads images on the local system automatically to
  your wordpress blog. 

  It is inspired by and based on a [[http://paste.lisp.org/display/69993][wordpress posting client for
  muse-mode]] written by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AshishShukla][Ashish Shukla]].

  org2blog is licensed under GPLv3

* Installation

  Download org2blog for github

  : git clone http://github.com/punchagan/org2blog.git
  
  Add the org2blog directory to your load path and then add

  : (require 'org2blog)

  to your dot emacs.  You can optionally save the xmlrpc url of your
  blog and the username.

  : (setq org2blog-server-url "http://username.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php"
  :       org2blog-server-user "username")

  *Note* - org2blog depends on xml-rpc available at [[http://launchpad.net/xml-rpc-el][Launchpad]].  Add it
   to your load-path before using org2blog.
   
* Usage
  1. Log in using *M-x org2blog-login RET*.  Provide xmlrpc url,
     username, password and blog-id (not in use now; useful when
     editing posts).  Optionally, you could set these in your .emacs.  
     
  2. To start writing a new post use *M-x org2blog-new-entry RET*
     Tags to your post are comma separated values passed to KEYWORDS.
     Categories are comma separated values passed to DESCRIPTION.
     Completion (for both) is triggered using *C-c t*.    

  3. Use *C-c p* to Publish or *C-c d* to post as draft. 

  4. You could also publish your exiting org files.
     - Add #+TITLE, #+OPTIONS, #+KEYWORDS, #+DESCRIPTION, #+DATE,
       to your file.  All of these are Optional.  If a #+TITLE is
       absent, your post will be untitled.

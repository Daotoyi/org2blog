* Introduction

This is an informal test plan for Org2Blog. It only includes commands.
Reviewing each of them will give you a sense of how the system works. Perhaps
reviewing the smallest units of functionality is a better way to learn the
system compared to studying it all once. In service of those goals, just
enough detail is provided here to make sense of testing without becoming mind
numbingly painful.

The tests are split up logically and informally. The preequisites are obvious.
For example you need a blog before you can post, and you need a user before
you can log in. Each test has /some/ notes about what should happen, maybe along
with a reference. All of the commands are also accessible by the UI if that is
easier for you. Ideally you test the command directly and also via the UI.

The easiest way to use this is to copy this file to your computer and check
off items as you go. Please submit improvements and corrections. Have a
pleasant test run!

- "Simple things" like spelling and grammar fixes, typo correction, white
  space and formatting changes, and comment clean.
- Refactoring.

  only one. It is an opportunity toe better the documentation, the package
  itself, or more.

* Expectations

There are some things that will save you and everyone else some time here that
are expected of you when you do decide to make a contribution:

- Coding style and conventions :: The Emacs Lisp files should follow the
      [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tips.html][Emacs Lisp conventions]] and the [[https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide][Emacs Lisp Style Guide]].
- Use quality-checking tools :: Use [[https://melpa.org/#/flycheck][flycheck]], [[https://github.com/purcell/package-lint][package-lint]] and
     [[https://github.com/purcell/flycheck-package][flycheck-package]] to help you identify common errors in your package
     metadata. Use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tips.html][checkdoc]] to make sure that your package follows the
     conventions for documentation strings.
- *Review existing issues* :: [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/issues][The issue tracker]] may already have them solved,
     otherwise they are a great place to start
- *Review the* :: [[%5B%5Bhttps://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/wiki%5D%5Bwiki%5D%5D ][Read more]] to learn more about how the entire package worksâ€”you
                  don't need to know all of Org2Blog to get a lot of value out
                  of it. You might be surprised to learn that it already has
                  what you need. This also gives you context for where
                  something me be contributed.
